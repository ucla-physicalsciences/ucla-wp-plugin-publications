Needed:
- Custom post type for publications  ✓
- Taxonomy for year  ✓
- Custom fields for primary components 

Primary Components:
- author (link to author profile?)
- title
- journal OPTIONAL
- volume OPTIONAL
- pages OPTIONAL
- date of publication OPTIONAL
- DOI OPTIONAL
- ISSN OPTIONAL
- URL (link to full publication OPTIONAL


Potential component:
- images/graph/illustrations  

Classification:
- per year ✓  _This is implemented, but redundant with the "date of publication" that all posts should have.  Let's just have author._
- per author _This is the key taxonomy classification for publications!_
- per field  _Let's leave this until later_
- archive?  _Publications won't need an archive. –Cody_

Questions: 
- What is the requirement for a publication to be put in archive? (year, #of publication on the publication page?...) _All pubs should be live (unless retracted!)_
- Would you prefer a 'block editor editing experience'? _Let's leave this as a separate project. A great idea, but custom posts/fields pre-dates the new blocks.  The code would be separate (and the projects 'orthogonal')_
