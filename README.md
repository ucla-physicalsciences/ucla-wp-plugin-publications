- pages OPTIONAL✓
- date of publication OPTIONAL✓
- DOI OPTIONAL✓
- ISSN OPTIONAL✓
- URL (link to full publication OPTIONAL)✓


Potential component:
- images/graph/illustrations  (in progress, added but formatting to modify)

Classification:
- per author ✓_This is the key taxonomy classification for publications!_
- per field  _Let's leave this until later_

Questions monday: 
- What is the requirement for a publication to be put in archive? (year, #of publication on the publication page?...) _All pubs should be live (unless retracted!)_
- Would you prefer a 'block editor editing experience'? _Let's leave this as a separate project. A great idea, but custom posts/fields pre-dates the new blocks.  The code would be separate (and the projects 'orthogonal')_

Sunday : 
I have implemented a basic usage of field for publication that works. Right now, i'm working on implementing constant custom fields that will stay within the "publication implementation page" (so that the editor just has to add the info about their article without having to add/look for a new field that matches the info they want to put up. I'm planning to match the formatting of publications website (no graph) but i was wondering if you'd rather have the formatting we saw at meeting last monday. 
I have just implemented an image component. I need to work on the formatting for the page (for each publication) for now it shows up as a banner but i'd like it to show like the illustration/graph positioning from the example that we saw at meeting.
